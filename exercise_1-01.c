#include <stdio.h>                 // include  information  about  standard  library

int main()                         // define  a  function  called  main that  received  no  argument  values
{                                  // statements  of  main  are  enclosed  in  braces
	printf("hello, world\n");  // main  calls  library  function  printf to  print  this  sequence  of  characters
